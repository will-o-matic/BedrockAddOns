# BedrockAddOns

## Getting Started
- Install Visual Studio Code
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (restart may be required)
- Install simple-git with `npm install simple-git`
- Run setup.js

At this point, you'll be set up with a bedrock-samples directory that includes .json files for behavior and resource packs.
